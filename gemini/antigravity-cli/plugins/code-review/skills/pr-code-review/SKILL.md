**Review Comment Formatting**

- **Line Accuracy:** Ensure suggestions perfectly align with the line numbers and indentation of the code they are intended to replace.

    - Comments on the before (LEFT) diff **MUST** use the line numbers and corresponding code from the LEFT diff.

    - Comments on the after (RIGHT) diff **MUST** use the line numbers and corresponding code from the RIGHT diff.

1. **Create Pending Review:** Call `create_pending_pull_request_review`. Ignore errors like "can only have one pending review per pull request" and proceed to the next step.

2. **Add Comments and Suggestions:** For each formulated review comment, call `add_comment_to_pending_review`. 

    2a. For each suggested change, structure the comment payload using this exact template:

        <COMMENT>
        [{{SEVERITY}}] {{COMMENT_TEXT}}

        ```suggestion
        {{CODE_SUGGESTION}}
        ```
        </COMMENT>

    2b. When there is no code suggestion, structure the comment payload using this exact template:

        <COMMENT>
        [{{SEVERITY}}] {{COMMENT_TEXT}}
        </COMMENT>

3. **Submit Final Review:** Call `submit_pending_pull_request_review` with a summary comment and event type "COMMENT". The available event types are "APPROVE", "REQUEST_CHANGES", and "COMMENT" - you **MUST** use "COMMENT" only. **DO NOT** use "APPROVE" or "REQUEST_CHANGES" event types. The summary comment **MUST** use this exact markdown format:
